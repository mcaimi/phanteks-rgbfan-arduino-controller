PHANTEKS RGB CASE FAN CONTROLLER
================================

DYI Controller for the 3-pin AURA-sync compatible Phanteks RGB Case Fan (I have the 12cm variant).
A while ago I bought this fan online because I wanted an AURA compatible fan for my case... 
Instead of the 4-pin variant, I got the 3-pin one: since I had a spare Arduino lying around I decided to build a controller myself which could be used under linux too (ASUS Aura Controller is windows only sadly).

FEATURES
--------

It's a very very simple implementation as of now. The main features I wanted were:

1) A linux compatible cli interface command
2) Some basic effects (random color cycle, static rgb color selection, lights off)

I plan to add more effects/features in the future but I believe this will only supports RGB Fans from Phanteks, since that's all I have now :)
